  <h1> Hawaii Beach resort </h1>
  <h2> 27 July 2024 </h2>
  <p>Hawaii beaches are among the most beautiful and exotic in the world. We have long stretches of soft white sand caressed by warm blue water. We also have black sand, green sand, and red sand beaches. We have beaches where waterfalls cascade into the ocean from sea cliffs, and beaches made of millions of tiny, round pebbles. We have calm beaches were babies like to play, and we have some of the mightiest waves the world has ever seen. When it comes to beaches, Hawaii has it all.</p>
